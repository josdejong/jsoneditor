JSON Editor is a web-based tool to view, edit, format, and validate JSON. It has various modes such as a tree editor, a code editor, and a plain text editor. The editor can be used as a component in your own web application. It can be loaded as CommonJS module, AMD module, or as a regular javascript file.

The library was originally developed as core component of the popular web application https://jsoneditoronline.org and has been open sourced since then.

Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

Continuous integration tests are run on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/actions), and [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) is used to test on all major browsers.

Thanks, GitHub Actions and LambdaTest for the generous support for this open source project!

## Successor: svelte-jsoneditor

This library [`jsoneditor`](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) has a successor: [`svelte-jsoneditor`](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor). The new editor is not a one-to-one replacement, so there may be reasons to stick with `jsoneditor`. 
The main differences between the two [are described here](https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor#differences-between-josdejongsvelte-jsoneditor-and-josdejongjsoneditor).

## Install

with npm (recommended):

    npm install jsoneditor

Alternatively, you can use another JavaScript package manager like https://yarnpkg.com/, or a CDN such as https://cdnjs.com/ or https://www.jsdelivr.com/.

## Use

> Note that in the following example, you'll have to change the urls `jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.js` and `jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.css` to match the place where you've downloaded the library, or fill in the URL of the CDN you're using.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- when using the mode "code", it's important to specify charset utf-8 -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <link href="jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <script src="jsoneditor/dist/jsoneditor.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="jsoneditor" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"></div>

    <script>
        // create the editor
        const container = document.getElementById("jsoneditor")
        const options = {}
        const editor = new JSONEditor(container, options)

        // set json
        const initialJson = {
            "Array": [1, 2, 3],
            "Boolean": true,
            "Null": null,
            "Number": 123,
            "Object": {"a": "b", "c": "d"},
            "String": "Hello World"
        }
        editor.set(initialJson)

        // get json
        const updatedJson = editor.get()
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```


## Build

The code of the JSON Editor is located in the folder `./src`. To build 
jsoneditor:

- Install dependencies:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

- Build JSON Editor:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  This will generate the files `./jsoneditor.js`, `./jsoneditor.css`, and  
  minified versions in the dist of the project.

- To automatically build when a source file has changed:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  This will update `./jsoneditor.js` and `./jsoneditor.css` in the dist folder
  on every change, but it will **NOT** update the minified versions as that's
  an expensive operation.


## Test

Run unit tests:

```
npm test
```

Run code linting ([JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)):

```
npm run lint
```
